      "Mark": "At the end of the marked character's turn, if that character is still marked, the Burrower teleports to a space adjacent to that character, dealing [fray] damage. If the character is flying, they take no damage. If the character has no other characters or terrain pieces adjacent, they take 3[D] instead and are slowed. Then, the mark and all associated effects end."
