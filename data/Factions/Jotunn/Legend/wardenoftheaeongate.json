It can use Primal Sisyphus and Chains of Fate to pull characters back into Polaris or Eternal Star, or yank them into a bad position for Staff of Eternal Order's time effect. Characters can ameliorate this somewhat with the Unmoor aura, making the character bearing it very important. At phase III, characters will have very little time to burn the Warden down before it flattens them with divine meteors."
