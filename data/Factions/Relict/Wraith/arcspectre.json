      "Description": "Creates a massive network storm in range, which could overlap characters. The storm is a small blast terrain effect that is dangerous terrain, which the [name] and allies ignore. Foes in the storm are vulnerable+. Using this ability again with an active storm can move the storm 2 spaces instead of replacing it. If used this way, it costs 1 action. At round 3+, moving a storm is a free action."
