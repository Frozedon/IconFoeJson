While a foe is grabbed, the foe and the Crusher are immobile, and the grabbed foe takes [D] damage at the start of their turns. If shoved or moved apart, or this ability is used again, the grab ends. A foe can repeat the save at the end of their turn to end a grab (they still fail if they are winded)."
