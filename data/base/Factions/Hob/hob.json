      "Description": "Hobs can (technically) be bargained with, and will occasionally flee or surrender when they are badly losing a fight. Unless greatly pressed, hobs that are considered kin will never kill characters intentionally, preferring to punish or humiliate.\n• Motivations: Hobs are usually strongly motivated by trespass or injury against the land. Some are motivated by some perceived slight or offense against some ancient bargain, rule, or compact. Still others are simply motivated by natural beauty or whimsy and don't see malice in their own actions.\n• Flee: Being immortal nature spirits, being killed doesn't really bother a Hob (they will usually return with the next season), but they can be flighty and will run away if afraid."

Some Hobs are made of almost pure aether, flickering spirits that seem real until they dance away through the air. These hobs have the Spirit Away trait. Other Hobs are more solid and possess bodies of beasts or natural materials, such as stone, wood, or water. These hobs have the Body of the Land trait.",
