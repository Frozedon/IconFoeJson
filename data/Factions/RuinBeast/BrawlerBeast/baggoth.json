      "Description": "An adjacent foe must save or be picked up in a crushing hug by the Baggoth, making them immobile. They fail the save if they are winded or dazed. At the end of that foe's next turn, if they're still adjacent, they take damage equal to 100% of their max hp. This damage is reduced by 50% for every character other than the Baggoth adjacent to the targeted character, and the effect ends if either break adjacency."
