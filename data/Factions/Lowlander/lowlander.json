      "Description": " Lowlanders are kin, can be bargained with, and will flee or surrender if heavily outnumbered or heavily losing a fight.\n• Motivations: Lowlanders nearly always fight for territory or supplies. Negotiating for them for passage through their territory usually involves doing a favor or payment, and they typically respect fair deals. They prefer to take captives in battle and ransom them back later.\n• Flee: Lowlanders are survivors and won't hesitate to back down from a fight they know they will lose - conversely, they won't hesitate to exploit weaknesses."
