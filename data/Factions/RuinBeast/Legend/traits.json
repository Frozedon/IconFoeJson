    "Name": "Monstrous Heads",
    "Description": "The Chimaera has three heads, chosen or rolled for from the following list, each unique. Each head has a unique set of powers, shares the chimaera's space, is separately targetable, and has its own hit points (1/3 of its max HP, rounded up). Statuses, marks, or other effects only affect the currently acting head. Only one head is targetable at a time, even if an attack has area of effect. Damage that 'spills over' on one head is lost.\nEach time the Chimaera takes a turn, it takes a turn with only one of its heads. A different head must act from the last head that acted, unless there is only one head left. The Chimaera is only defeated when all three heads are defeated."
