      "Description": "If fighting scavengers, the GM places valuables tokens on the battlefield equal to the number of players +1. Valuables can be picked up by any character by moving into their space. They don't provide obstruction, can't be targeted, and can share space with anything except other valuables tokens. Characters drop them in adjacent spaces when defeated, or can drop them voluntarily as 1 action. Any character that ends a fight holding two or more valuables tokens gains 1 dust. Valuables tokens left on the battlefield don't count."
