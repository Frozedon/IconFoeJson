If the victim rolls higher, at the start of their turn they take [fray] damage and may re-emerge from any pit of their choice at the start of their turn. If they lose the roll-off, they take [fray] damage three times instead, and the Borer chooses which pit they emerge from at the start of their turn. The Borer returns to any open pit of its choice at the start of its turn."
