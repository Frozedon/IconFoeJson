Characters entering one of these terrain effects during their own turn can grab on to the zip line, removing them from the battlefield, then place themselves in free adjacent space to the other terrain effect, then fly 1. This effect can interrupt abilities and other movement, but can only take place once a turn. If a new zip line is placed, the old one is removed."
