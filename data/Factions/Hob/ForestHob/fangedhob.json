      "Description": "The [name] ends its turn and clamps fangs down on an adjacent foe's leg. The [name] becomes unstoppable, and moves into and shares their space, moving when they dash, rush, fly or teleport. After any ability resolves that damages that foe, the [name] deals 2 damage to them and shoves them 1 in any direction. At the start of the [name]'s next turn, they detach, ending this effect. It also ends if the [name] and their target are separated for any reason."
